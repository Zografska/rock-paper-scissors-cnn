## 🚀 About

This project is a little **convolutional neural network (CNN)** that recognizes hand gestures for **rock, paper, and scissors** using computer vision.

I built it for my **Master’s class: Statistical and Machine Learning** at the **University of Milan**, where it earned me a **29/30** grade 🎓.

It was also my **first experience with neural networks** - and honestly, it was a lot of fun to explore 🤓.

## 🧠 Tech Stack

- **Python** 🐍
- **TensorFlow** & **Keras** 🤖
- **OpenCV** 👁️
- **NumPy** 🔢

## 🎮 Features

- ✨ Real-time gesture recognition
- 📷 Play rock-paper-scissors with your webcam
- 🎲 Simple, fun, and addictive!

## 🤓 Training & Reflections

- The model was trained on a prepared dataset inside `data/` 📂
- I tested it with my **own hand gestures**, and quickly realized something interesting:  
  👉 The **background still plays a big role** in recognition.
  - Results were **worse than expected** when tested in different environments.
  - This means there’s **room for improvement**, like background removal or data augmentation.

Even so, the project gave me a **fresh perspective on machine learning** and boosted my curiosity to dive deeper.
